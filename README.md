# Topological Data Analysis for Time Series Classification
TDA was used to extract topological features from [UCR](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com) time series classification datasets. In our project we argue that topological features may help to identify interesting patterns in data in which shape has meaning. This repo contains the pipeline for extracting the topological features and evaluation of multiple classification algorithms on this features. [Giotto-tda](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda), a high-performance topological machine learning toolbox in Python built on top of scikit-learn library, was used to extract topological features from the input data using persistent homology and combine these features with machine learning methods.
